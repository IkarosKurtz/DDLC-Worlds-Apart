## Notes

- DDLC Worlds Apart is a work in progress. Expect bugs and missing features.

- DDLC Worlds Apart is not affiliated with Team Salvato. DDLC AI is a fan project.

- DDLC Worlds Apart is not a replacement for DDLC. It begins after the events of DDLC.

- Sometimes the AI gets stuck in a process, I try to fix this error. For now, just restart the AI.

- This mod stores Monika Memories in a MongoDB database, if you don't want to use it, it also can sotore them in a JSON file. By default, it uses a JSON file.

- I'm making a video about this project, I will upload it to my YouTube channel (named IkarosKurtz), I will put the link here when is ready.

## Features

- **Generative Conversations**: Speak freely and receive human-like responses.
- **Memory-Rich Interactions**: The AI recalls past discussions, making every conversation nuanced and unique.
- **Expansive Environments**: The clubroom is just the beginning.

## Technology

At the core of DDLC AI is a Generative Agent, inspired by cutting-edge research from Google and Stanford University. Powering these interactions is ChatGPT, specifically the `gpt-3.5-turbo` variant, boasting 175 billion parameters.

üìÑ [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf)

Our bespoke implementation introduces optimizations, ensuring faster and seamless dialogues. A cornerstone of our project is the long-term memory system, obviating the conventional token limitations and archiving essential memories in MongoDB. Note: Usage of ChatGPT necessitates charges for the OpenAI API.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - For backend processes.
2. DDLC Worlds Apart Repository.

```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
```
env\Scripts\activate
```
5. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Configure your .env:
  * `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API Key.
  * `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB Connection URI. (Optional)

7. Run the AI:
```
python api.py
```  

### MOD Setup

1. Download the rar from releases tab [here](https://github.com/IkarosKurtz/DDLC-Worlds-Apart/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha).
2. Extract the rar. You should get a folder called `DDLC Worlds Apart`.
